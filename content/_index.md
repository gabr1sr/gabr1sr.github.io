Hello and welcome!

My name is Gabriel. I'm a self-taught software developer turning into security researcher.

I write mostly about blockchain technologies and programming languages, but you will find short tutorials, operating systems, and productivity topics too.

You can find my projects [here](https://github.com/gabr1sr) and contact me via [e-mail](mailto:gabr1sr@proton.me) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gabr1sr).
